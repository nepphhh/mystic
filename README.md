## Important files
Websocket server: /src/main.go
Game server: /src/main.rs
Client root js file: /src/client/js/client.js
Index file is obviously: /src/client/index.html

Everything is processed and put into /dist/ thanks to gulp.

    sudo snap install go --classic
    sudo snap install --edge node --classic

2) Install rust:
    sudo apt install curl
    sudo curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
